# explAIner

This repository contains the source code for [_explAIner_](https://explainer.ai/) -- the framework for explainable AI and interactive machine learning.


## Architecture

The framework consists of four plugins, which represent the _stages of explanation_, namely

* Understanding
* Diagnosis
* Refinement
* Reporting


## Repository Structure

### Folders 
The repository contains 4 folders:

* `backend/`
  This folder contains the python backend for the high-level (model in-/output) explanations.

* `tensorboard-explainer-plugin/`  
  This folder contains the actual explAIner code. It has the following sub-folders:
  * `explainer_plugins/`  
    * `_1_understanding/`  
      Plugin for understanding. Data-independent explanations.
    * `_2_diagnosis/`  
      Plugin for diagnosis. Debugging of NN graph.
    * `_3_refinement/`  
      Plugin for refinement. Recommendations on improvements.
    * `_4_reporting/`  
      Plugin for reporting. Summarizes the findings from previous steps.
    * `common/`  
      Parts that are used in more than one plugin.
  * `explainer_tensorboard/`  
    The modified TensorBoard executable, with explAIner plugins injected.


## Building and Starting

To create example logs for explAIner, run the following command and wait for it to finish:

```Bash
docker-compose up --build --remove-orphans explainer_summary
```

To build and start the explAIner TensorBoard executable (together with custom backend servers):

```Bash
docker-compose up --build --remove-orphans -d explainer_tensorboard
```
Although the containers should be up and running after a few seconds, it might take a while until the code is fully compiled and the system gets available under `http://127.0.0.1:6006`.
